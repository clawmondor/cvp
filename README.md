# Contents Valuation Prototype

Internal ops tool for producing **Contents Inventory and Valuation Reports** for first-party property insurance claims. Built for Los Angeles attorneys handling Palisades and Eaton fire cases.

This is **not a customer-facing application.** Attorneys never log in. Specialists use it to build reports; attorneys receive the finished PDF and CSV by email.

---

## What it does

A specialist receives a folder of photos, video walkthroughs, and a partial inventory spreadsheet from an attorney. The tool helps them:

1. Create a **matter** (one claim = one matter) with all policy and policyholder metadata
2. **Upload evidence** — photos, receipts, policy documents — stored locally
3. **Scan photos with Claude Vision** to generate draft line items from images
4. **Review and confirm items** — correct descriptions, assign rooms, enter ages and quantities
5. **Price each item** — paste a retailer URL, capture the price, record match type and source
6. **Compute ACV automatically** using a straight-line depreciation schedule with condition multipliers and category floors
7. **Preview the report** as a full HTML render before export
8. **Export** a polished PDF and a Xactimate-compatible CSV

---

## System requirements

- **macOS** (tested on macOS 14+)
- **Python 3.11+**
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — Python package and environment manager
- **Homebrew** packages for PDF rendering:

```bash
brew install pango cairo libffi
```

> WeasyPrint (the PDF engine) requires Pango and Cairo system libraries. The app will fail loudly at PDF export time if these are missing.

---

## Local development setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd tor
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This creates a `.venv/` in the project root and installs all runtime and dev dependencies.

### 3. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in the values below. The auth variables are new and required — the app will start without them but login will not work.

**Required for Vision scans:**
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

**Required for authentication:**
```
# Generate with: python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
JWT_SECRET=<64-char hex string>

# Generate with: uv run python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<fernet key>

# Base URL used when generating invite registration links
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

**Local development convenience (disables login entirely — never use in production):**
```
ENVIRONMENT=dev
COOKIE_SECURE=false
# AUTO_LOGIN_USER_ID=<system_admin_uuid>   # fill in after step 6 below
```

See [Configuration reference](#configuration-reference) for all variables.

### 4. Apply database migrations

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Creates `./data/cvp.db` and applies all schema migrations. The `./data/uploads/`, `./data/exports/`, and `./data/crops/` directories are created automatically on first run.

### 5. Seed the category table

```bash
uv run seed
```

Populates the 42 depreciation categories from `docs/depreciation-schedule.md`. Idempotent — safe to run multiple times.

### 6. Create the initial System Admin account

There is no default admin account. You must bootstrap one manually on a fresh database. Run this once:

```bash
uv run python - <<'EOF'
from cvp.db import SessionLocal
from cvp.auth import hash_password
from cvp.models_auth import Group, User

EMAIL = "admin@example.com"   # change this
PASSWORD = "replace-me-now"   # change this — min 12 chars

db = SessionLocal()
try:
    # Create the internal group if it doesn't exist
    group = db.query(Group).filter(Group.kind == "internal").first()
    if group is None:
        group = Group(name="Internal", kind="internal")
        db.add(group)
        db.flush()

    if db.query(User).filter(User.email == EMAIL).first():
        print(f"User {EMAIL} already exists — skipping.")
    else:
        user = User(
            email=EMAIL,
            display_name="Admin",
            password_hash=hash_password(PASSWORD),
            system_role="system_admin",
            group_id=group.id,
        )
        db.add(user)
        db.commit()
        print(f"Created system_admin: {user.id}")
        print(f"Add to .env:  AUTO_LOGIN_USER_ID={user.id}")
finally:
    db.close()
EOF
```

Copy the printed UUID into `.env` as `AUTO_LOGIN_USER_ID` to bypass login during local development (the app will load as that user on every request without a login form). Leave the variable unset or empty for production.

> Once logged in as System Admin, all subsequent users are created and invited through the admin panel at `/admin/system/users`. See [docs/RBAC.md](docs/RBAC.md) for the invite flow and role hierarchy.

### 7. Start the development server

```bash
uv run dev
```

Opens the app at **http://127.0.0.1:8000** with auto-reload enabled.

If `AUTO_LOGIN_USER_ID` is set, the app skips login entirely and goes straight to the dashboard. If it is not set, navigate to `/login` and sign in with the credentials you set in step 6.

---

## Production deployment

This app is designed to run on Railway (service + Postgres + volume) behind Cloudflare. See `docs/RUNBOOK.md` for the full first-deploy runbook and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-hosting-design.md` for the architecture rationale (including the no-PITR / usage-billing tradeoffs that drove the choice).

Quick summary:

1. Create a Railway project from this repo. `railway.toml` pins the builder to Docker and configures healthcheck + pre-deploy command.
2. Add a Railway Postgres plugin; reference its `DATABASE_URL` from the web service's Variables.
3. Add a 10 GB volume mounted at `/app/data`.
4. Set required env vars (see `.env.example` — `SECRET_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `APP_BASE_URL`, `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ENVIRONMENT=production`). Do NOT set `DATABASE_URL` or `PORT` — Railway provides them.
5. Configure Cloudflare CNAME (proxied) → `<service>.up.railway.app`, SSL mode Full (strict). Add the custom domain on the Railway side too.
6. Set a Railway usage alert (recommended) to catch unexpected cost changes.
7. Deploy. Log in with bootstrap credentials, complete MFA, **then remove `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from Railway Variables**.

## Data model overview

**Core tables:**

- **matters** — one row per insurance claim; holds all policy metadata, status, and delivery tracking
- **rooms** — named spaces within the insured property (bedroom, kitchen, etc.), linked to a matter
- **items** — the core inventory: one row per line item with RCV, ACV, source citation, and confirmation state
- **categories** — 42 rows from `docs/depreciation-schedule.md`; drives the depreciation formula; read-only in v0
- **evidence_files** — uploaded photos, PDFs, and other files; tracks scan status
- **vision_runs** — one row per Claude Vision API call; stores the raw response for auditing

**Auth and access tables:**

- **groups** — organizations: one `internal` group (the company) plus one `external` group per law firm / client
- **users** — authenticated users with a `system_role`, `group_id`, optional MFA secret, and invite state
- **refresh_tokens** — server-side refresh token records (hashed); supports revocation
- **matter_access** — per-user, per-matter permission grants (`viewer` / `editor` / `contributor` / `manager`)
- **comments** — item-level comments with `visibility` (`internal` or `shared`)
- **audit_logs** — append-only event log for auth and data mutations

All currency is stored as **integer cents**. Conversion to dollars happens only at the display and export layer.

Full schema rationale in `docs/data-model.md`. For access control design see `docs/RBAC.md`.

## Depreciation formula

```
straight_line_dep_rate  = 1 / useful_life_years
accumulated_dep         = min(straight_line_dep_rate × age_years × condition_multiplier,
                              1 − acv_floor_pct)
acv_unit_cents          = round(rcv_unit_cents × (1 − accumulated_dep))
acv_total_cents         = acv_unit_cents × quantity
```

**Condition multipliers:**

| Condition | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| Excellent | 0.75 |
| Above average | 0.90 |
| Average | 1.00 |
| Below average | 1.15 |

Items in non-depreciable categories (artwork, jewelry, collectibles, precious metals) are presented at RCV with no depreciation applied. Full methodology in `docs/depreciation-schedule.md`.

---

## Configuration reference

All settings are read from `.env` at startup via pydantic-settings. Every variable has a default so the app starts without a complete `.env`, but authentication will not work until the auth variables are set.

**Application:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `""` | Required for Claude Vision photo scanning |
| `VISION_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-6` | Model used for Vision scans |
| `VISION_MODEL_FALLBACK` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Fallback model |
| `PORT` | `8000` | Port the dev server listens on |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./data/cvp.db` | SQLite database path |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | `./data/uploads` | Where evidence files are stored |
| `EXPORT_DIR` | `./data/exports` | Where PDFs and CSVs are written |
| `COMPANY_NAME` | `Contents Valuation LLC` | Appears in report headers and footers |
| `COMPANY_ADDRESS` | `""` | Appears in report cover page |
| `COMPANY_EMAIL` | `""` | Appears in report cover page |
| `COMPANY_PHONE` | `""` | Appears in report cover page |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `""` | Base URL prepended to invite registration links (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`) |

**Authentication:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `production` | Set to `dev` to enable dev-mode bypasses |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `""` | Secret key for signing JWTs. Generate with `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`. **Required for login to work.** |
| `JWT_ACCESS_TTL_MINUTES` | `60` | Access token lifetime in minutes |
| `JWT_REFRESH_TTL_DAYS` | `7` | Refresh token lifetime in days |
| `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `""` | Fernet key for encrypting TOTP secrets at rest. Required before MFA can be enabled. |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `true` | Set to `false` for local HTTP development |
| `AUTO_LOGIN_USER_ID` | `""` | **Dev only.** UUID of a user to load on every request without JWT validation. Only active when `ENVIRONMENT=dev`. |

---

## Local QA testing

Automated browser-based QA tests verify auth, RBAC, evidence uploads, item management, comments, and exports against the running dev server.

See **[docs/QA.md](docs/QA.md)** for full setup and usage.

Quick start:
```bash
# Install browser
uv run playwright install chromium

# Add to .env
# QA_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
# QA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password

# Run all suites
uv run python skills/qa/runner.py

# Run a specific suite
uv run python skills/qa/runner.py --suite auth
```

---

## Important constraints

- **No cloud services** beyond the Anthropic API. Everything runs on localhost.
- **Currency is always integer cents.** Never use Python `float` for currency math.
- **Vision scans are sequential** with a 500ms pause between images. Do not parallelize.
- **Do not commit** `.env`, `./data/`, or `./backups/` — all are gitignored.
- Reports are **attorney work product** and include a "Confidential — Attorney Work Product" marker.
- **`AUTO_LOGIN_USER_ID` is for local development only.** It bypasses all authentication. Never set it in production (`ENVIRONMENT=production` will not activate the bypass regardless, but do not set it).
- **`JWT_SECRET` and `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be kept secret.** Rotating `JWT_SECRET` invalidates all active sessions. Rotating `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` breaks all stored MFA secrets — users will need MFA reset.
- **No self-registration.** All users are created by an admin via an admin panel and receive an invite link. See [docs/AUTH.md](docs/AUTH.md).
